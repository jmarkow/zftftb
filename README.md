# Welcome (i.e. what does this do?)

This is a MATLAB toolbox of time-frequency tools, some of which are based on the Gardner & Magnasco reassignment technique, and the newer contour based technique of Lim & Gardner.  Also, these functions depend on the [markolab .m files](https://github.com/jmarkow/markolab) being in your MATLAB path.  See the wiki for details.

Detailed documentation lives [here](zftftb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
