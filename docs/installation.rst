Installation
=============

Simply clone the ZFTFTB github repository, and add the directory and subdirectories to your MATLAB path (including any dependencies, see below).  An installation script is included that automates the entire process.

Requirements
------------

This has been tested using MATLAB 2010A and later on Windows and Mac (Linux should be fine). You must have the ` markolab <https://github.com/jmarkow/markolab>`_ toolbox in your MATLAB path. The only MATLAB Toolbox required is the Signal Processing toolbox, which is typically included in most standard installations.

Using the install script
